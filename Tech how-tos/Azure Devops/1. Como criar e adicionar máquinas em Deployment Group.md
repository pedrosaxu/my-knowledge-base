- PAT: To register an agent, you must be a member of the Administrator role in the agent pool. The identity of the agent pool administrator is needed only at the time of registration. The administrator identity isn't persisted on the agent, and it's not used in any subsequent communication between the agent and Azure Pipelines or TFS. After the agent is registered, there's no need to renew the personal access token because it's required only at the time of registration.
