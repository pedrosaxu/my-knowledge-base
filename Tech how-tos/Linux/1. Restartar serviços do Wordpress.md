Each Bitnami stack includes a control script that lets you easily stop, start and restart services.

Obtain the status of a service:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh status
```

Call it without any service name arguments to start all services:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh start
```

Or use it to restart a single service, such as Apache only, by passing the service name as argument:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart <service>
```

Opções de serviços:
- mariadb
- apache
- wordpress

Use this script to stop all services:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
```

Restart the services by running the script without any arguments:

```
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
```
